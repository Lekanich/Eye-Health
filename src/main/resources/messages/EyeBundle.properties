eye.dialog.exercise.palm_eye=The Palm Eye. \
Start by cupping your hands over the sockets of your closed eyes. Stare into the far back of the dark space. You will notice that the various residual hues in your vision slowly turn to black. Do this simple exercise for a minimum of 30 seconds. It serves as a reset button for your vision and freshens your eyes.
eye.dialog.exercise.eye_press=The Eye Press. \
This eye exercise also uses your hands to relax your eyes. Close your eyes and inhale deeply. Put all your fingers on your eyelids and press lightly. Use a bit of gentle pressure on your eyes. Hold them for about 10 seconds. Slowly let go of your eyes. Keep them open for a couple of seconds as your vision comes back into focus. You can blink a bit to help reorient your eyes. Then repeat the eye press. Try to do this 10 times for maximum eye relief.
eye.dialog.exercise.palming=Palming. \
Palming is one of the best eye exercises you can do to relieve tired, worn eyes. It's like a warm eye compress on the go! Rub both palms together until they are nice and warm. Or you can wash them in very warm water to heat them up. Then place both palms over your closed eyelids. The warmth of your hands will gently heat your eyes. You will feel the muscles of your eyes begin to relax. Keep your palms there until all the heat has been absorbed by your eyes. Repeat once (or twice) for best results.
eye.dialog.exercise.zooming=Zooming. \
Another great eye exercise for healthy eyes is called zooming. This is great for those who look at a computer screen all day at work. Sit on a chair in your best posture. Hold your arm straight out in front of you with your thumb up. Keep your eyes on your thumb. Slowly bend your elbow to bring your thumb closer to your eyes.
eye.dialog.exercise.figure_eights=Figure Eights. \
Sit in your best posture with your feet flat on the floor. Put your hands flat on your knees. Then lift up your right hand straight out in front of you with the thumb pointing up. Keep your head still and look at your thumb. Use your thumb to trace a figure 8 in the air while keeping your arm totally straight. Move in both a clockwise and a counter-clockwise direction for a total of 5 repetitions. Next, repeat the exercise with your left thumb.
eye.dialog.exercise.writing_messages_on_the_wall=Writing Messages on the Wall. \
This is a good exercise to strengthen and work your eye muscles. First, stand or sit facing a blank wall that is at least 8 feet away. There shouldn't be any pictures or windows on the wall. Next, imagine that your eyes are lasers, just like a superpower! Then use them to write words on the wall. Trace all the words with your laser eyes. This exercise will make your eye muscles move very fast in a variety of directions. As a result, your weakest eye muscles will get stimulation and a great workout. Write words with your eyes for about 20 seconds and then take a small rest. Repeat for a total of 2 minutes for best results.
eye.dialog.exercise.slow_blink=Slow Blink. \
One of the adverse side effects of looking at screens all day is that we don't blink very often. Blinking is important as it helps to keep our eyes properly lubricated. This exercise supports the health of your eyes. It's also a wonderful way to refresh tired, itchy dry eyes. Look straight ahead of you at a blank wall. Next, slowly close your eyes. Keep your eyes closed for half a second. Then slowly open them again. Repeat this slow blink 20 times in a row. You will feel your eyes getting refreshed with each blink. Your eyes will also feel more lubricated right away.
