	Zooming
</h1>
<p>
	Another great eye exercise for healthy eyes is called zooming. This is great for those who look at a computer screen all day at work. Sit on a chair in your best posture. Hold your arm straight out in front of you with your thumb up. Keep your eyes on your thumb. Slowly bend your elbow to bring your thumb closer to your eyes.
