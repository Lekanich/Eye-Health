	Zooming
</h1>
<p>
	Another great eye exercise for healthy eyes is called zooming. <br/>
	This is great for those who look at a computer screen all day at work. <br/>
	Sit on a chair in your best posture. <br/>
	Hold your arm straight out in front of you with your thumb up. <br/>
	Keep your eyes on your thumb. <br/>
	Slowly bend your elbow to bring your thumb closer to your eyes.
