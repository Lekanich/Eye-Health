	Writing Messages on the Wall
</h2>
<p>
	This is a good exercise to strengthen and work your eye muscles. <br/>
	First, stand or sit facing a blank wall that is at least 8 feet away. <br/>
	There shouldn't be any pictures or windows on the wall. <br/>
	Next, imagine that your eyes are lasers, just like a superpower! <br/>
	Then use them to write words on the wall. <br/>
	Trace all the words with your laser eyes. <br/>
	This exercise will make your eye muscles move very fast in a variety of directions. <br/>
	As a result, your weakest eye muscles will get stimulation and a great workout. <br/>
	Write words with your eyes for about 20 seconds and then take a small rest. <br/>
	Repeat for a total of 2 minutes for best results.
