<h1>
	Writing Messages on the Wall
</h1>
<p>
	This is a good exercise to strengthen and work your eye muscles. First, stand or sit facing a blank wall that is at least 8 feet away. There shouldn't be any pictures or windows on the wall. Next, imagine that your eyes are lasers, just like a superpower! Then use them to write words on the wall. Trace all the words with your laser eyes. This exercise will make your eye muscles move very fast in a variety of directions. As a result, your weakest eye muscles will get stimulation and a great workout. Write words with your eyes for about 20 seconds and then take a small rest. Repeat for a total of 2 minutes for best results.
