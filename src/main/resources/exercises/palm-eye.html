	The Palm Eye
</h2>
<p>
	Start by cupping your hands over the sockets of your closed eyes. <br/>
	Stare into the far back of the dark space. <br/>
	You will notice that the various residual hues in your vision slowly turn to black. <br/>
	Do this simple exercise for a minimum of 30 seconds. <br/>
	It serves as a reset button for your vision and freshens your eyes.
