	The Palm Eye
</h1>
<p>
	Start by cupping your hands over the sockets of your closed eyes. Stare into the far back of the dark space. You will notice that the various residual hues in your vision slowly turn to black. Do this simple exercise for a minimum of 30 seconds. It serves as a reset button for your vision and freshens your eyes.
