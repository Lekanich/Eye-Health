<h1>
	The Eye Press
</h1>
<p>
	This eye exercise also uses your hands to relax your eyes. Close your eyes and inhale deeply. Put all your fingers on your eyelids and press lightly. Use a bit of gentle pressure on your eyes. Hold them for about 10 seconds. Slowly let go of your eyes. Keep them open for a couple of seconds as your vision comes back into focus. You can blink a bit to help reorient your eyes. Then repeat the eye press. Try to do this 10 times for maximum eye relief.
