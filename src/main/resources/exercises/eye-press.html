	The Eye Press
</h1>
<p>
	This eye exercise also uses your hands to relax your eyes. <br/>
	Close your eyes and inhale deeply. <br/>
	Put all your fingers on your eyelids and press lightly. <br/>
	Use a bit of gentle pressure on your eyes. <br/>
	Hold them for about 10 seconds. <br/>
	Slowly let go of your eyes. <br/>
	Keep them open for a couple of seconds as your vision comes back into focus. <br/>
	You can blink a bit to help reorient your eyes. <br/>
	Then repeat the eye press. <br/>
	Try to do this 10 times for maximum eye relief.
