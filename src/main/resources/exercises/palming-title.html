	Palming
</h1>
<p>
	Palming is one of the best eye exercises you can do to relieve tired, worn eyes. <br/>
	It's like a warm eye compress on the go! <br/>
	Rub both palms together until they are nice and warm. <br/>
	Or you can wash them in very warm water to heat them up. <br/>
	Then place both palms over your closed eyelids. <br/>
	The warmth of your hands will gently heat your eyes. <br/>
	You will feel the muscles of your eyes begin to relax. <br/>
	Keep your palms there until all the heat has been absorbed by your eyes. <br/>
	Repeat once (or twice) for best results.
