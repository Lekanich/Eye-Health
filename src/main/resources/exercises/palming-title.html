	Palming (Warm compress)
</h2>
<p>
	Warm your palms up (with warm water or rubbing) <br/>
	Place both palms over closed eyelids. <br/>
	The warmth of your hands will gently heat your eyes. <br/>
	You will feel the muscles of your eyes begin to relax. <br/>
	Repeat once (or twice) for the best results.
