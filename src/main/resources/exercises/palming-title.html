	Palming
</h1>
<p>
	Palming is one of the best eye exercises you can do to relieve tired, worn eyes. It's like a warm eye compress on the go! Rub both palms together until they are nice and warm. Or you can wash them in very warm water to heat them up. Then place both palms over your closed eyelids. The warmth of your hands will gently heat your eyes. You will feel the muscles of your eyes begin to relax. Keep your palms there until all the heat has been absorbed by your eyes. Repeat once (or twice) for best results.
