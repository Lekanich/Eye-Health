	Figure Eights
</h1>
<p>
	Sit in your best posture with your feet flat on the floor. Put your hands flat on your knees. Then lift up your right hand straight out in front of you with the thumb pointing up. Keep your head still and look at your thumb. Use your thumb to trace a figure 8 in the air while keeping your arm totally straight. Move in both a clockwise and a counter-clockwise direction for a total of 5 repetitions. Next, repeat the exercise with your left thumb.
