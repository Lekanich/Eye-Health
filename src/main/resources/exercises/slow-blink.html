	Slow Blink
</h2>
<p>
	One of the adverse side effects of looking at screens all day is that we don't blink very often. <br/>
	Blinking is important as it helps to keep our eyes properly lubricated. <br/>
	This exercise supports the health of your eyes. <br/>
	It's also a wonderful way to refresh tired, itchy dry eyes. <br/>
	Look straight ahead of you at a blank wall. <br/>
	Next, slowly close your eyes. <br/>
	Keep your eyes closed for half a second. <br/>
	Then slowly open them again. <br/>
	Repeat this slow blink 20 times in a row. <br/>
	You will feel your eyes getting refreshed with each blink. <br/>
	Your eyes will also feel more lubricated right away.
