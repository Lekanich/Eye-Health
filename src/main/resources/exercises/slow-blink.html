<h1>
	Slow Blink
</h1>
<p>
	One of the adverse side effects of looking at screens all day is that we don't blink very often. Blinking is important as it helps to keep our eyes properly lubricated. This exercise supports the
	health of your eyes. It's also a wonderful way to refresh tired, itchy dry eyes. Look straight ahead of you at a blank wall. Next, slowly close your eyes. Keep your eyes closed for half a second.
	Then slowly open them again. Repeat this slow blink 20 times in a row. You will feel your eyes getting refreshed with each blink. Your eyes will also feel more lubricated right away.
